# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions and deprecation warnings
# are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and
# Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks, and
# deprecation warnings, in the browser.
# If set to False, deprecation warnings and full exception messages
# will print to the console only. Exceptions will still display in the
# browser with a generic error message. For now, the exception type and
# traceback show in the browser also, but they will be removed in the
# future.
# Default: true
showErrorDetails = false
